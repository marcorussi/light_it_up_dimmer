LIGHT IT UP DIMMER


1 - BLE
1.1 - Remote control from advertising
1.1.1 - Scan of a remote controller advertising packet

The device scans periodically any eventual control device for retrieving a light command to actuate.
In case of a peripheral device is found then the advertised packet length is checked to be the expected one.
In case of positive result, first bytes of the packet are compared with the expected preamble defined 
in the firware as below:

FIRST_LENGTH_POS,					/* first length */
ADV_TYPE_FLAGS_POS,				/* adv flags type */
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED_POS,		/* BR/EDR not supported */
SECOND_LENGTH_POS,				/* second length */
MANUF_DATA_TYPE_POS,				/* manufacturer data type */
MANUF_ID_BYTE_0_POS,				/* manufacturer ID lower byte */
MANUF_ID_BYTE_1_POS,				/* manufacturer ID higher byte */
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH_POS,			/* data length */
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_0_POS,			/* service ID lower byte */
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_1_POS,			/* service ID higher byte */
DATA_BYTE_0_POS,					/* data byte 0 */
DATA_BYTE_1_POS,					/* data byte 1 */
DATA_BYTE_2_POS,					/* data byte 2 */
DATA_BYTE_3_POS,					/* data byte 3 */
DATA_BYTE_4_POS,					/* data byte 4 */
DATA_BYTE_5_POS,					/* data byte 5 */
DATA_BYTE_6_POS,					/* data byte 6 */
DATA_BYTE_7_POS,					/* data byte 7 */
CALIB_RSSI_POS,					/* calibrated RSSI */

with the defined values:

0x02,								/* first length */
ADV_FLAGS_TYPE,						/* adv flags type */
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED,				/* BR/EDR not supported */
(uint8_t)(MANUF_DATA_LENGTH + 4),	/* second length */
MANUF_DATA_TYPE,					/* manufacturer data type */
(uint8_t)MANUFACTURER_ID,			/* manufacturer ID lower byte */
(uint8_t)(MANUFACTURER_ID >> 8),	/* manufacturer ID higher byte */
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH,					/* manufacturer specific data length */
(uint8_t)MANUF_SERVICE_ID,			/* service ID lower byte */
(uint8_t)(MANUF_SERVICE_ID >> 8)	/* service ID higher byte */

The MANUFACTURER_ID is attributed at each company from Bluetooth SIG and in this case it is flash memory defined.
The SERVICE_ID is also flash memory defined and it is a custom field indicating a specific service implemented by the device. 
This field is used by other compatible products to understand the behaviour of the device.
The following 8 bytes are specific to the service ID and represent the shared data between devices that support that service.
The CALIB_RSSI field is a calibrated value of RSSI in two's complement. It is not used by a scanner device at the moment (TO BE DEFINED). 

1.1.2 - Remote control data
Advertised data from a remote controller are 8 byte long.
The defined service ID is the only supported and related data bytes are managed as below:

DATA_BYTE_0_POS: current controller state
DATA_BYTE_1_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_2_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_3_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_4_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_5_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_6_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_7_POS: not used 

Any new scanned controller state value is considered only if different than the previous one. The lower nibble of this value is used as index for an array of PWM values (4 channels in %) as below:
0 - {90, 90, 0, 0}
1 - {20, 20, 0, 0}
2 - {0, 0, 0, 0}
3 - {0, 0, 0, 0}
4 - {90, 0, 0, 0}
5 - {20, 0, 0, 0}
6 - {0, 0, 0, 0}
7 - {0, 0, 0, 0}
8 - {0, 90, 0, 0}
9 - {0, 20, 0, 0}
10- {0, 0, 0, 0}
11- {0, 0, 0, 0}


2 - Light management
The module manages 4 PWM channels. Every time a new PWM value is requested, the algorithm perform a soft change by calculating a PWM ramp starting from the current PWM value to the target one. This fade effect has a fixed speed (ramp inclination) set at module initialisation from the stored value in persistent memory. Indeed the fade percentage value is loaded once in the led_light_init() function. In case of a new value is written in the related characteristic, it won't be used until next power cycle (CONSIDER TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOUR).
